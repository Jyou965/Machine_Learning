## Libraries and Dependancies

This application leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs) - an end-to-end open source machine learning platform.

* [keras](https://keras.io/guides/) - a Python deep learning API library that offers consistent & simple APIs, minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and provides clear & actionable error messages. 

* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - tools for predictive data analysis.

* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index) -a hosted Jupyter notebook service that is well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education.It requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.

## Usage

This application works in three steps:

1. Preprocesses data for a neural network model.

2. Uses the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.

3. Optimizes the model.

By using the deep learning neural network model, investors and entrepreneurs can leverage large historical records to predict the probability of success of a project quickly.
